# SSO Club Hilfe (SSO Club Support Tool)
## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a relaunch of a former community initiative for the game Star Stable Online (SSO). Originally started as an Instagram-based help page for in-game clubs ([@sso.clubhilfe](https://www.instagram.com/sso.clubhilfe/?hl=de)), it grew into a broader service offering custom profile pictures, music videos, club promotion, and even simple websites.

Now, the idea is being rebuilt as a fullstack web application to automate and simplify many of the manual tasks we once handled—such as reviewing club submissions, writing promotional texts, creating social media assets, and organizing content.

The platform originally existed as a community-driven initiative on Instagram and a website ([former version here](https://sso-clubhilfe.jimdofree.com/)), and it will now evolve into a central hub for SSO players—offering tips & tricks, club promotion, and creative content like graphics and templates.
